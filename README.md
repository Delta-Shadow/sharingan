Sharingan (Pure JS Drawing)
---------------------------
The Sharingan, in my favourite anime "Naruto Shippuden", is a special eye which grants the wielder great visual powers. I drew this entirely in Js. I call it a drawing not an image, because it lacks colors. Check out the real image: https://goo.gl/WPcEbc
